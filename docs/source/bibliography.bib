@article{colonna_organic_2015,
 abstract = {The cumulative global capacity of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems for the conversion of renewable and waste thermal energy is undergoing a rapid growth and is estimated to be approx. 2000 MWe considering only installations that went into operation after 1995. The potential for the conversion of the thermal power coming from liquid-dominated geothermal reservoirs, waste heat from primary engines or industrial processes, biomass combustion, and concentrated solar radiation into electricity is arguably enormous. ORC technology is possibly the most flexible in terms of capacity and temperature level and is currently often the only applicable technology for the conversion of external thermal energy sources. In addition, ORC power systems are suitable for the cogeneration of heating and/or cooling, another advantage in the framework of distributed power generation. Related research and development is therefore very lively. These considerations motivated the effort documented in this article, aimed at providing consistent information about the evolution, state, and future of this power conversion technology. First, basic theoretical elements on the thermodynamic cycle, working fluid, and design aspects are illustrated, together with an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages in comparison to competing technologies. An overview of the long history of the development of ORC power systems follows, in order to place the more recent evolution into perspective. Then, a compendium of the many aspects of the state of the art is illustrated: the solutions currently adopted in commercial plants and the main-stream applications, including information about exemplary installations. A classification and terminology for ORC power plants are proposed. An outlook on the many research and development activities is provided, whereby information on new high-impact applications, such as automotive heat recovery is included. Possible directions of future developments are highlighted, ranging from efforts targeting volume-produced stationary and mobile mini-ORC systems with a power output of few kWe, up to large MWe base-load ORC plants.},

@article{denton_computational_1998,
 abstract = {Computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) probably plays a greater part in the aerodynamic design of turbomachinery than it does in any other engineering application. For many years the design of a modern turbine or compressor has been unthinkable without the help of CFD and this dependence has increased as more of the ﬂow becomes amenable to numerical prediction. The beneﬁts of CFD range from shorter design cycles to better performance and reduced costs and weight. This paper presents a review of the main CFD methods in use, discusses their advantages and limitations and points out where further developments are required. The paper is concerned with the application of CFD and does not describe the numerical methods or turbulence modelling in any detail.},

However, as engineers are exposed more and more to the results of CFD and less and less to experimental data there is a danger that they may not realise the limitations of CFD and so will view its predictions as more reliable than they really are and not question them sufficiently. This is particularly dangerous when CFD is use as part of an optimisation procedure. The objective of this paper is to try to expose some of the limitations of CFD as used for routine turbomachinery design.},

@article{fischer_comparison_2011,
 abstract = {A comparison of optimized trilateral cycle (TLC) - systems with water as working fluid and optimized organic Rankine cycle (ORC) – systems with pure organic working fluids is presented. The study includes the heat transfer to and from the cycles. The TLC - systems were optimized by the selection of the maximum water temperature, the ORC - systems by the selection of the working fluid and the process parameters. The optimization criterion is the exergy efficiency for power production being the ratio of the net power output to the incoming exergy flow of the heat carrier. Results will be presented for five different cases specified by the inlet temperature of the heat carrier and the inlet temperature of the cooling agent. The inlet temperature pairs are (350 °C, 62 °C), (280 °C, 62 °C), (280 °C, 15 °C), (220 °C, 15 °C) and (150 °C, 15 °C). It is found that the exergy efficiency for power production is larger by 14\%–29\% for the TLC than for the ORC. On the other hand, the outgoing volume flows from the expander are larger for the TLC than for the ORC by a factor ranging from 2.8 for the first case to 70 for the last case.},

Heat, mass and momentum transfer as well as the droplet dynamics are some of the important mechanisms that govern the two-phase flow. This paper presents numerical investigations of three-dimensional two-phase flow in a two-stage centrifugal compressor, incorporating the effects of the above mentioned mechanisms. The results of the two-phase flow simulations are compared with the simulation involving only the gaseous phase. The implications for the compressor performance, viz. the pressure ratio, the power input and the efficiency are discussed. The role played by the droplet-wall interactions on the rate of vaporization, and on the compressor performance is also highlighted.},

@article{li_comparison_2017,
 abstract = {Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) has been widely used for the recovery of low-grade heat into power such as solar energy and industrial waste heat. The overall thermal efficiency of ORC is affected by large exergy destruction in the evaporator due to the temperature mismatching between the heat source and working fluid. Trilateral Cycle (TLC) and Organic Flash Cycle (OFC) have been recognized as potential solutions because of their better performance on temperature matching between the heat source and working fluid at the evaporator. In this study, thermodynamic models of above three cycles are established in MATLAB/REFPROP. Results indicate that TLC obtains the largest net power output, thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency of 13.6 kW, 14.8\% and 40.8\% respectively at the evaporation temperature of 152℃, which is 37\% higher than that of BORC (9.9 kW) and 58\% higher than that of OFC (8.6 kW). BORC is more suitable under the conditions low evaporation temperature is relatively low due to the achieved maximum net power output, thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency. OFC has the minimum net power output, thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency under all the conditions of evaporation temperature compared to TLC and BORC. As for the UA value, TLC has the largest one ranging from 7.9 kW/℃ to 8.8 kW/℃ under all conditions while OFC gains the minimum UA value at low evaporation temperature and BORC gains the minimum UA value at high evaporation temperature.},

@article{ziaja_numerical_2021,
 abstract = {The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) represents an emerging technology aimed at exploiting lower temperature heat sources, such as waste heat in industrial processes or exhaust heat in combustion engines. One key aspect of this technology is the efficient and economical operation at part load, typically realized by a partial admission control, which is challenging to predict numerically. Full-annulus computation can only be avoided applying empirical partial admission loss models to conventional full-admission computations. This article aims at assessing the reliability of such a loss model under real-gas and supersonic conditions as a first step toward knowledge-based improved loss models. Three different operating points of an 18.3 kW ORC turbine working with an ethanol–water mixture with two open stator passages (2 × 36 deg) are considered. Full-annulus computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computations are compared to experimental data and results of simulations in a conventional, full-admission, periodic 72 deg-sector model with application of a one-dimensional partial admission loss model. The experimentally obtained mass flow rate and efficiency are matched overall within their measurements accuracy. By highest inlet total pressure, the computed efficiency deviates about 4\% from the experiments. Predictions of efficiency based on the full-admission and loss model correction deviate from full-annulus computations less than 1\%. These findings suggest that the used empirical correlations for partial admission losses can provide acceptable results in the configuration under investigation.},
