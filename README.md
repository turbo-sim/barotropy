# Barotropy

Enhance your two-phase turbomachinery CFD simulations with **`barotropy`**, a Python package designed to create barotropic fluid property models. The barotropic approximation assumes that fluid properties (e.g., density, viscosity, speed of sound) depend solely on pressure, which is a very accurate assumption for most turbomachinery flows. This simplification reduces computational costs while improving convergence reliability in simulations involving complex fluid property variations, such as supercritical CO‚ÇÇ compressors or two-phase flows in nozzles and turbines.


üìö **Documentation**: [https://turbo-sim.github.io/barotropy/](https://turbo-sim.github.io/barotropy/) *(under construction)*  
üì¶ **PyPI package**: [https://pypi.org/project/barotropy/](https://pypi.org/project/barotropy/)



## Key Features

- **Simplified Fluid Modeling:** Generate barotropic models to lower computational cost and enhance solver robustness compared to real-gas fluid property tables.  
- **Optimized for Two-Phase Flows:** Simulate two-phase flows with one or two-components using the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (HEM) or the Delayed Equilibrium Model (DEM) assumptions..  
- **Seamless Integration with Commercial CFD Solvers:** Easily export barotropic models as simple expressions ready to be copy-pasted into ANSYS Fluent or ANSYS CFX.

## üöÄ User installation (via PyPI)

To begin using `barotropy`, install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install barotropy
```

After installation, verify that everything is set up correctly by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -c "import barotropy; barotropy.print_package_info()"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer installation (from source with Poetry)

This guide walks you through installation for development using `Poetry`, which manages both dependencies and virtual environments automatically.

1. **Install Poetry**  
   Follow the official guide: [Poetry Installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)  
   Then verify the installation:
   ```bash
   poetry --version
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/turbo-sim/barotropy
   cd barotropy
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and create a virtual environment**  
   This installs all required packages listed in `pyproject.toml`:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```
   To deactivate:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

5. **Verify the installation**  
   Run the following inside the Poetry shell or with `poetry run`:
   ```bash
   poetry run python -c "import barotropy; barotropy.print_package_info()"
   ```

6. **Install additional packages**  
   To add a runtime dependency:
   ```bash
   poetry add <package-name>
   ```
   To add a development-only dependency:
   ```bash
   poetry add --dev <package-name>
   ```
