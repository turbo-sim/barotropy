# Barotropy

Enhance your two-phase turbomachinery CFD simulations with **`barotropy`**, a Python package designed to create barotropic fluid property models. The barotropic approximation assumes that fluid properties (e.g., density, viscosity, speed of sound) depend solely on pressure, which is a very accurate assumption for most turbomachinery flows. This simplification reduces computational costs while improving convergence reliability in simulations involving complex fluid property variations, such as supercritical COâ‚‚ compressors or two-phase flows in nozzles and turbines.

ðŸ“¦ **PyPI package**: [https://pypi.org/project/barotropy/](https://pypi.org/project/barotropy/)

ðŸ“š **Documentation**: [https://turbo-sim.github.io/barotropy/](https://turbo-sim.github.io/barotropy/) *(under construction)*  

ðŸŽ“ **Tutorials**: [https://turbo-sim.github.io/barotropy/source/tutorials.html](https://turbo-sim.github.io/barotropy/source/tutorials.html)  
*Step-by-step examples for using the barotropic model in CFD solvers like Ansys Fluent and CFX.*


## Key Features

- **Simplified fluid modeling:** Generate barotropic models to lower computational cost and enhance solver robustness compared to real-gas fluid property tables.  
- **Suited for homogeneous two-phase flows:** Simulate two-phase flows with one or two-components using the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (HEM) or the Delayed Equilibrium Model (DEM) assumptions..  
- **Seamless integration with commercial CFD solvers:** Easily export barotropic models as simple expressions ready to be copy-pasted into ANSYS Fluent or ANSYS CFX.

## ðŸš€ User installation (via PyPI)

To begin using `barotropy`, install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install barotropy
```

After installation, verify that everything is set up correctly by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -c "import barotropy; barotropy.print_package_info()"
```
